For example, express the calculation \"add 8 and 7, then multiply by 2\" as 2 \u00d7 (8 + 7). Recognize that 3 \u00d7 (18932 + 921) is three times as large as 18932 + 921, without having to calculate the indicated sum or product .", "children": [], "standard_slug": "2", "retrieved": "2016-12-31 23:38:48.952691"}
